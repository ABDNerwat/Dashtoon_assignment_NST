# Dashtoon_assignment_NST
In order to add an artistic style to a content image of our choice, I chose the well established method of Neural Style Transfer (NST). It utilizes the VGG-19 Image Classification Neural Network to apply transfer learning to images.
I have attached a Jupyter notebook as asked which includes the entirety of my procedure. The research article I referred to for the same is linked to in the notebook. But I'll link it here as well - https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.06576v2.pdf
